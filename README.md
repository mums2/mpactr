## Overview

mpactr is a collection of filters for the purpose of identifying high
quality MS1 features by correcting peak selection errors introduced
during the pre-processing of tandem mass spectrometry data.

Filters in this package address the following issues:

- `filter_mispicked_ions()`: removal of mispicked peaks, or those
  isotopic patterns that are incorrectly split during preprocessing.
- `filter_group()`: removal of features overrepresented in a specific
  group of samples; for example removal of features present in solvent
  blanks due to carryover between samples.
- `filter_cv()`: removal of non-reproducible features, or those that are
  inconsistent between technical replicates.
- `filter_insource_ions()`: removal of fragment ions created during the
  first ionization in the tandem MS/MS workflow.

All filters are independent, meaning they can be used to create a
project-specific workflow, or you can learn more in [the Filter
vignette](https://mums2.github.io/mpactr/articles/filter2.html).

## Installation
