#' Mispicked ions filter
#'
#' @description
#' `filter_mispicked_ions()` identifies ions that were incorrectly split into
#' separate features during preprocessing. This filter checks the feature table
#' for similar ions in terms of mass and retention time. Peaks found to be
#' similar are merged into a single feature given `merge_peaks` is `TRUE`.
#'
#' The parameter `ringwin` is the detector saturation mass window, specific for
#' some instruments, such as Waters Synapse G2-Si-Q-ToF, to account for high
#' concentration samples.
#'
#' Parameter `isowin` is the isotopic mass window, which accounts for isotopic
#' peaks of the same precussor mass that were incorrectly assigned during
#' preprocessing.
#'
#'
#' `copy_object`: mpactr is built on an R6 class-system, meaning it operates on
#' reference semantics in which data is updated *in-place*. Compared to a
#' shallow copy, where only data pointers are copied, or a deep copy, where
#' the entire data object is copied in memory, any changes to the original
#' data object, regardless if they are assigned to a new object, result in
#' changes to the original data object. We recommend using the default
#' `copy_object = FALSE` as this makes for an extremely fast and
#' memory-efficient way to chain mpactr filters together; however, if you
#' would like to run the filters individually with traditional R style objects,
#' you can set `copy_object` to `TRUE` as shown in the filter examples.
#'
#' @param mpactr_object An `mpactr_object`. See [import_data()].
#' @param ringwin Ringing mass window or detector saturation mass window.
#' Default = 0.5 atomic mass units (AMU).
#' @param isowin Isotopic mass window. Default = 0.01 AMU.
#' @param trwin A `numeric` denoting the retention time threshold for assessing
#' if ions should be merged. Default = 0.005.
#' @param max_iso_shift A `numeric`. Default = 3.
#' @param merge_peaks A `boolean` parameter to determine if peaks found to
#' belong to the same ion should be merged in the feature table.
#' @param merge_method If merge_peaks is TRUE, a method for how similar peaks
#' should be merged. Can be one of "sum".
#' @param copy_object A `boolean` parameter that allows users to return a copied
#' object instead of modifying the object.
#' @return an `mpactr_object`.

### Group filter     ##
#######################
#' Filter Ions by Group
#'
#' @details
#' `filter_group()` removes feature ions that are present in a user-defined
#' group based on a relative abundance threshold. This could be particularly
#' useful to filter out features found present in solvent blank samples.
#' Further, this filter can be ultilized to remove features in media blank
#' sample for experiments on microbial cultures.

#' The presence or absence of features in a group of samples is determined by
#' first averaging injection replicates and then averaging biological
#' replicates within each biological treatment group. A feature is present in
#' a group if its abundance is greater than the user-defined `group_threshold`.
#' The default is 0.01, meaning a feature is removed if its abundance is 1% of
#' that in the sample group in which it is most abundant. For example, blank
#' filtering can remove features whose mean abundance in solvent blank
#' injections is greater than 1% of their maximum mean abundance in experimental
#' samples.
#'
#' If you would like to remove features found in media blank
#' samples, we recommend testing the `group_threshold` parameter.
#'
#' `copy_object`: mpactr is built on an R6 class-system, meaning it operates on
#' reference semantics in which data is updated *in-place*. Compared to a
#' shallow copy, where only data pointers are copied, or a deep copy, where
#' the entire data object is copied in memory, any changes to the original
#' data object, regardless if they are assigned to a new object, result in
#' changes to the original data object. We recommend using the default
#' `copy_object = FALSE` as this makes for an extremely fast and
#' memory-efficient way to chain mpactr filters together; however, if you
#' would like to run the filters individually with traditional R style objects,
#' you can set `copy_object` to `TRUE` as shown in the filter examples.
#'
#'
#' @param mpactr_object An `mpactr_object`. See [import_data()].
#' @param group_threshold Relative abundance threshold at which to remove ions.
#' Default = 0.01.
#' @param group_to_remove Biological group name to remove ions from.
#' @param remove_ions A `boolean` parameter. If `TRUE` failing ions will be

#' Filter Non-reproducible ions
#'
#' @description
#' `filter_cv()` removes feature ions that are found to be non-reproducible

#' or median coefficient of variation (CV) between technical replicates. As
#' such, this filter is expecting an input dataset with at least two replicate
#' injections per sample.

#'
#' @param mpactr_object An `mpactr_object`. See [import_data()].
#' @param cv_threshold Coefficient of variation threshold.
#' A lower cv_threshold will result in more stringent filtering and higher

#' Filter Insource ions

#' @description
#' `filter_insource_ions()` identifies and removes in-source ion clusters based
